DONE: 
    - Basic font parser(ttf only tho)
    - Semi-functional msdf texture atlas generator
    - Boilerplate vulkan code with a simple window set up
    - Semi functional keyboard listener


- TO DO CURRENTLY: 
    - Improve the text quality, very blurry and it looks weird with janky artifacts
    - Organize the vulkan code better and remove useless stuff
    - Use instancing for memory bandwith savings
    - Make the code more readable
    - File organization for functionality
    - Improved + optimized texture atlas generation
    - Make font_parser have support for other font file types
